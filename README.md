# Personal Portfolio – Md Abrar Fahim

Multi-page personal portfolio focused on **IT support**, **software**, and **data/ML** skills.

This site was created to showcase my background for IT help desk and technical support opportunities.

## Pages

- `index.html` – Overview / About
- `skills.html` – IT, programming, and data skills
- `projects.html` – Selected projects (web app, embedded systems, ML)
- `experience.html` – Education and roles
- `contact.html` – Contact details and CV download

All pages share a common navigation bar and styling (`style.css`).

## How to View Locally

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser.

## How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub, for example:  
   `abrar232/portfolio` (any name is fine).
2. Upload all files in this folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `skills.html`
   - `projects.html`
   - `experience.html`
   - `contact.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `README.md`
   - Your CV PDF (e.g. `Md_Abrar_Fahim_CV.pdf`)
3. Commit and push the changes (or use the GitHub web interface to upload).
4. In the GitHub repository:
   - Go to **Settings → Pages**.
   - Under **Source**, choose `Deploy from a branch`.
   - Select the `main` (or `master`) branch and the `/root` folder.
   - Click **Save**.
5. GitHub will build the site. After a short time, you’ll get a public URL like:  
   `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/`

Use this URL as the example of your website in applications.

## Customisation

- Update the text in each page to better match the specific role.
- Replace the placeholder LinkedIn URL in `contact.html` with your real profile.
- Update the CV download link if you change the filename.
- You can adjust colours and layout in `style.css`.
